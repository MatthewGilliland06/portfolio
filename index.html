        <p> I am a high school graduate. I will be attending UAH for a bachelors in Computer Science this fall. I'm making this to gauge my skill and show it off. I will continuously update this as I learn more because it's obviously not much to look at now</p>

            <p>I forgot all about coding during Covid but knew it was what I still had my interest in computers and how they worked. I saw that my high school was offering AP Computer Science Principles and decided to take that.
                 During that class I learned more about how computers operate and I learned python. My final project was a drawing application,complete with different colors, brushes, and a reset button.</p>
